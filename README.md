# Titanic Dataset Visualization – Exploratory Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using data visualization techniques.  
The goal is to understand patterns and factors that influenced passenger survival through visual exploration.

## Objective
The objective of this assignment is to apply visualization techniques on a real-world dataset to:
- Explore data structure and feature relationships  
- Identify trends and patterns affecting survival  
- Gain insights before applying machine learning models  

## Dataset
- **Name:** Titanic Dataset  
- **Source:** Kaggle dataset  
- **Description:** Contains demographic, socio-economic, and travel-related information of passengers, along with survival status.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

## Key Steps Performed
- Loaded and explored the dataset  
- Handled missing values  
- Performed feature understanding (Age, Gender, Class, SibSp, Parch)  
- Created visualizations to analyze survival patterns  
- Summarized insights from visual analysis  

## Key Insights
- Gender, passenger class, and age had a strong influence on survival.  
- Female and first-class passengers showed higher survival rates.  
- Family-related features such as SibSp and Parch provided additional context.  

## Conclusion
Visualization helped uncover meaningful patterns and relationships in the Titanic dataset.  
This exploratory analysis forms a strong foundation for future predictive modeling tasks.

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository  
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook  
3. Ensure the Titanic.csv file is in the same directory  
4. Run cells sequentially
